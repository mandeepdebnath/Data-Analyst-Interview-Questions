# Data Analyst Interview Questions

Hi! I'm Mandeep, in this repo I've gathered and curated the questions that have been asked in the interviews for Data Analyst roles in different companies.

The questions are not organized in a company-specific model, rather it's presented as commulative collection of questions that I've found and also shared by the people who faced those interviews.

Keep in mind that this is not an ultimate list and I will keep updating it with more question in time. Also, bear in mind that this does not guarantee that you will be asked the same questions. Keep this as a reference and a place to evaluate yourself to keep upskilling.
